In one fact table, there can be multiple facts. So the fact itself is just the numerical measurement that is used to track the performance of a certain business process. And the table is the entire table itself that keeps track of all of those facts, foreign keys, and everything included in this fact table.

And it is actually even possible that a fact table has no single fact at all. Fact is usually a numerical value, so a measurement that tracks some kind of performance. But sometimes in some fact tables, only the dimensional aspects of a certain event or a certain transaction is recorded. So in this case, we don't have any facts, and we have basically a factless fact table.

The Factless Fact Table can answer below questions
- How many employees have been registered last month?
- How many employees have been registered in a certain region?
- etc..
