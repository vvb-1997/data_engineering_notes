# What is an array?

In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements , each
identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each
element can be computed from its index by a mathematical formula.

# Operations on different array types

- [[One Dimensional Array]]
- [[Two Dimensional Array]]
# When to use/avoid Arrays

## When to use
- To store multiple variables of same data type
- Random access
## When to avoid
- Same data type elements
- Reserve memory


# Summary

- Arrays are extremely powerful data structures
- Memory is allocated immediately 
- Elements are located in contiguous locations in memory 
- Indices start at 0 
- Inserting elements 
- Removing elements
- Finding elements
