Implement the ==find_kth_from_end== function, which takes the LinkedList and an integer k as input, and returns the kth node from the end of the linked list ==WITH==T USING LENGTH==.  
  
Given this LinkedList:  
  
==1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4==  
  
If ==k=1== then return the first node from the end (the last node) which contains the value of ==4==.  
  
If ==k=2== then return the second node from the end which contains the value of ==3==, etc.  
  
If the index is out of bounds, the program should return ==None==.  
  
The find_kth_from_end function should follow these requirements:

1. The function should utilize two pointers, slow and fast, initialized to the head of the linked list.
2. The fast pointer should move k nodes ahead in the list.
3. If the fast pointer becomes None before moving k nodes, the function should return None, as the list is shorter than k nodes.
4. The slow and fast pointers should then move forward in the list at the same time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
5. The function should return the slow pointer, which will be at the k-th position from the end of the list.

## Solution

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
      
    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.head == None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        return True
  
def find_kth_from_end(ll, k):
	
	# 1. Initialize two pointers, 'slow' and 'fast', both pointing to the starting node of the linked list.
    fast = ll.head
    slow = ll.head
    
    # 2. Move the 'fast' pointer 'k' positions ahead.
    for _ in range(k):
	    
	    # 2.1. If at any point during these 'k' movements, the 'fast' pointer reaches the end of the list, then it means the list has less than 'k' nodes, and thus, returning None is appropriate.
        if fast is None:
            return None
        
        # 2.2. Move the 'fast' pointer to the next node.
        fast = fast.next
	
	# 3. Now, move both 'slow' and 'fast' pointers one node at a time until the 'fast' pointer reaches the end of the list. Since the 'fast' pointer is already 'k' nodes ahead of the 'slow' pointer, by the time 'fast' reaches the end, 'slow' will be at the kth node from the end.
    while fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

	# 4. Return the 'slow' pointer, which is now pointing to the kth node from the end.
    return slow

my_linked_list = LinkedList(1)
my_linked_list.append(2)
my_linked_list.append(3)
my_linked_list.append(4)
my_linked_list.append(5)

k = 2
result = find_kth_from_end(my_linked_list, k)

print(result.value)  # Output: 4
```

## Expected Output

```python
"""
    EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    ----------------
    4
    
"""
```

## Detailed Explanation

Let's dive into a detailed explanation of the ==find_kth_from_end== function. This function is designed to retrieve the kth node from the end of a linked list.  
  
For this example, let's consider a linked list with the nodes:

==1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8==

If we want to find the 3rd node from the end (i.e., k = 3), this node will be ==6==.

==Method Walkthrough:==

```python
def find_kth_from_end(ll, k):
```

==Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, at the head of the linked list:==

```python
slow = fast = ll.head 
```

Both pointers start at the head of the linked list. We'll advance the ==fast== pointer first to create a gap of ==k== nodes between ==slow== and ==fast==.

==Move the fast pointer k nodes ahead:==

```python
for _ in range(k):
```

This loop will advance the ==fast== pointer ==k== nodes forward, thereby creating a gap of ==k== nodes between ==slow== and ==fast==.

==Check if we've gone beyond the end of the list:==

```python
if fast is None:
	return None 
```

If, while moving the ==fast== pointer k steps, we find that ==fast== becomes ==None==, it means that the linked list has fewer than ==k== nodes. Therefore, the kth node from the end doesn't exist, so we return ==None==.

==Continue moving both pointers until the fast pointer reaches the end:==

```python
while fast:
	slow = slow.next
	fast = fast.next
```

At this stage, we continue moving both pointers at the same speed. By the time the ==fast== pointer reaches the end of the list, the ==slow== pointer will have advanced by the length of the list minus ==k== nodes. This positions the ==slow== pointer at the kth node from the end.

Illustrative Steps for the list ==1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8== and k = 3:

- Both ==slow== and ==fast== start at node 1.
- We first advance the ==fast== pointer 3 nodes ahead. After this step, ==slow== is still at node 1, and ==fast== is at node 4.
- Now, we move both pointers at the same speed. When ==fast== reaches node 8 (the last node), ==slow== is at node 5.
- The while loop will run one more time which will leave ==slow== pointing to the 6 node which is the 3rd node from the end.

==Return the node where the slow pointer is located:==

```python
return slow
```

At this point, the ==slow== pointer is pointing to the kth node from the end. We return this node.

==Conclusion:== The ==find_kth_from_end== function uses the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the kth node from the end of a linked list. By first positioning the fast pointer ==k== nodes ahead of the slow pointer and then moving both pointers at the same speed, we ensure that when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer is at the desired kth node from the end. In our example, the function would return node ==6== as the 3rd node from the end.
