So if we have a look at our product dimension, this is the data, how it might come out of our system. And if we have a look at the product ID, we see that this is a alpha numerical number, and they can be usually quite bulky and not really nice to handle. And they have a couple of disadvantages associated with them. Also, if we have a look at a transactional table, we can again see a bulky, and it can be even a lot larger number. And this is just referring to the transaction ID basically that is generated by the source system. And now this is not the ideal way of how we have things managed in our data warehouse. And those are now our natural keys, but we don't want to usually leave it that way. So we have learned a natural key, it's just coming out of the source system.

Generate our surrogate keys. And this is then nothing but a artificial key. And therefore, it is sometimes also just called an artificial key. And like this, we can see that it's opposed to the natural key because we create those surrogate keys in our ETL process. And they are just very ==simple integer numbers==. And also to understand that those are actually our surrogate keys, we have usually the suffix PK for primary key and FK for the foreign keys. And with those suffix, we can then usually immediately recognize that this is the surrogate key. And as mentioned, they are just ==created in the database or by the ETL tool==. And also this process is very simple usually. So it's not a lot of additional work, but we have quite some benefits with that.

# Benefits of Surrogate Key
- Improve performance (less storage/better joins)
- Handle dummy values (nulls / missing values) e.g. 999 or 1
- Integrate multiple source systems
- Easier administrate / update
- Sometimes there are even no natural keys available

# Practical guidelines
- Always use surrogate keys in tables as main PK and FK
- Both for Facts & Dimensions (except date dimension)
- Optionally keep the natural keys
