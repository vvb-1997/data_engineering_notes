IN ETL, we just extract the data to some staging layer, and then we do these transformations. And with the data being transformed, we load it in our data warehouse. And then of course, it is consumed by the different BI applications. This means that the transformations are basically applied when the data is moved. And this is now different in the ELT. So in the ELT, we basically just switch around the order of loading and transforming. So in ELT, we first just extract the data, and load the data immediately in the data warehouse. And this is then, of course, not where we want to stop, because, of course, we still want to apply our transformations.

With ELT, we do this using usually SQL commands in the database itself. This means that we need to leverage the compute power of the target database. So our data warehouse. And this, of course, since we want to apply our transformations on the go, we require a lot more compute power. So with the rise of the cloud technologies, and cloud data warehouses, such as Snowflake, which can use massive parallel processing, we can now make use of that, and now apply our transformations just on the go, because we have all of that compute power. And now, we are just more flexible with our transformations, because we don't need to plan them out in the beginning, but we can just apply them more flexibly on the go.

And then every user, if we have multiple analysts, they can all run their own queries and use SQL for that. So they can, for example, also create views, and they can, like this, just get the transformations more flexibly on the goal. Another advantage is that now we don't need to transform our data before we load it, which makes the extraction process, and the loading much, much faster, because these transformations can be much more compute-intensive. And this prevents us from loading our data, and running our ETL in very high frequencies, because this ETL can take more time, because we always need to apply those transformations. But now if we just extract and load the data immediately, we can be really a lot, a lot faster.

So if we need to have real-time data in our data warehouse, so whenever the data appears in the data sources, immediately, it should be loaded into the data warehouse. In such situations, we can also benefit from using an ELT instead of an ETL. So whenever we have some streaming data sources that immediately can get the data into our data warehouse, then this is a good choice to fulfill real-time requirements. Of course, we also want to note that the tool that we use can be really the same. So we can still use Pentaho, or other ETL tools that just extract, and load the data into our data warehouse. We just need to have a super powerful target database, and then we can benefit from this ELT. But now, the question, with these benefits, is an ETL now obsolete? And of course, the answer is no. An ETL is still the most commonly used process to load, and transform the data into our data warehouse. But there can be some, in some situations, benefits and some use cases when we want to use an ELT instead of an ETL.
